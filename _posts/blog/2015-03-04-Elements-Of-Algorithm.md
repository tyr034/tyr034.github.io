##Introduction:
There are infinite problems out there waiting to be solved. The only thing we could do is to seize the 
unchang: Basics Elements of Algorithms. 

##Principles: 
<ul>
	<li> There should be one (and preferably only one) obvious way to do it </li>
	<li> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea </li> 
</ul>

##Elements:
###Two Pointers:
 2Sum/3sum/4Sum..., Intersection of Two Lists, Valid Palindrome, Linked List Cycle, Sorting and Rearranging of a List 

###Binary Search:
sqrt(x), pow(x,y),Median of Two Sorted Array, Search in Rotated Sorted Array

###For Loop and Recursion (Backtracking): 
Depth-first Search, All Kinds of Path Problems in Tree, Surroned region in a Matrix, Permutations, Combinations, Subsets. 

###Dynamic Programming: 
Maximum Subarray, Buy and Sell Stock 

###Useful Data Structures: 
####HashTable: 
the single most important data structure when you need a O(1) lookup
####Queue/Stack: 
when you need to maintain certain order: Find the first non-repeating characters in a string;
####Priority Queue/ Heap: 
merge K sorted List 
####Prefix Tree
